For the start of the class, we have selected four short readings. Please have these read for Monday, August 27.

If you're interested, we've gone ahead and uploaded all this week&rsquo;s readings (and some additional ones) [here](https://www.are.na/lukas-eigler-harding/typography-interaction-1-skills-intensive). 

Also, please download the trial version of [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/get/). We will be doing a demo on basic functionality, but feel free to play around beforehand.
