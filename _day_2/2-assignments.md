### Assignment 1

Consider our in-class discussions, critiques, and experiments exploring typographic hierarchy...
How might we guide a reader’s eye through pattern and repetition? How might we ease a [user, consumer, audience, reader]’s navigation of interfaces, charts, and texts through spacing and type styles? How might we consciously add opinion and perspective to text through typographic hierarchy?

*Part A*

Select and download your [content.zip](assets/content.zip) from the class site. To continue exploring the effects of hierarchy on legibility, navigability, and perspective, create three different web designs, each should explore a different content structure (text index, grid w/ images, 'featured' content, drop downs). Each design will be presented in custom artboard at Desktop dimensions (1440 x 900) and can use multiple artboards per design.

You should generate and use Sketch Symbols for your designs. Additionally, utilize at least one instance of hotspots and fixed elements for each design. Be prepared to show your designs in Sketch’s preview setting.
