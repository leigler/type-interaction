### Assignment 1

Consider our in-class discussions, critiques, and experiments exploring typographic hierarchy...

*Part A*

To continue exploring the effects of hierarchy on legibility, navigability, and perspective, introduce hierarchy to this content in three separate ways. Each method will be presented in tabloid format, and should give weight to your selected content differently.
