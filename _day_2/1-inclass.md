### Exercise 3: Intervention

Spend the extended lunch period walking outside. Pay attention to how stores “brand” themselves. Find a particular typographic system that you find interesting. Document the brand execution with your phone (photograph the logo, spatial typography, print typography, and material uses). 

Once you’re back in studio, spend some time studying your photographs. What typographic systems can you identify (does there seem to be a grid? A color palette? Do they use several typefaces?)? Write these down, and spend some time recreating the branding system in Sketch, keeping in mind to produce symbols when necessary. 

Now experiment. What happens when you swap a typeface? What happens when everything becomes monochrome? What kind of mood shift is produced (ex: does Nike suddenly feel like a Halal stand? Does Starbucks feel like a bank?)?

After some experimenting, decide upon a “rebrand” and develop an updated style-guide of symbols and type styles. Prepare your before/after compositions in Sketch using the initial and rebranded symbol set.

Please upload your completed sketch documents and assets to the [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZQ0fJ3U7UB_Pc33-t2hlZx7exY2pGSSh?usp=sharing) under 'Exercise 3'

Create a folder with your name and inside place the document and any necessary assets. Please name your files as 'firstname_lastname_3'
