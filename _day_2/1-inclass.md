### Exercise 3: Intervention

Spend the extended lunch period walking outside. Pay attention to how stores “brand” themselves. Find a particular typographic system that you find interesting. Document the brand execution with your phone. 
Once you’re back in studio, spend some time studying your photographs. What typographic systems can you identify (does there seem to be a grid? A color palette? Do they use several typefaces?)? Write these down, and spend some time recreating and playing around with the branding system in illustrator. What happens when you swap a typeface? What happens when everything becomes monochrome? What kind of mood shift is produced (ex: does Nike suddenly feel like a Halal stand? Does Starbucks feel like a bank?)?

After some experimenting, decide upon a “rebrand” and re-introduce this intervention into your documentation photographs (these can be rough). Prepare your before/after photographs to share with the class with a focus on what typographic moves you’ve focused on to change the brand.
