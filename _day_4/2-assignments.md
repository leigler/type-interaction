A reader is a curated collection of texts meant to explore or present a given topic. 

The Active Reader is a collaboratively built website that displays the readings, experiments, research and references we have collected and examined over the past week.

Your assignment is to design and build a part of our class’ web-reader. Your assignment consists of the development of a type system that can be applied to:
- A web-based table of contents (i.e. a menu section of your webpage)
- A selected reading typeset for the web in html + CSS 
	- Your typeset reading should include: Title, Author, original publishing source and date, full text, links to any inspirational sources and directly related texts (either found in your own research or from the class list)
- A separately designed printable pdf of each reading (8.5x11”)

Each student’s reader contribution will be built into a resource hosted at [typeinteraction.teachinginter.net/reader](http://typeinteraction.teachinginter.net/reader) and is meant to act as a base resource for the rest of the semester.


Spend today researching and compiling visual and written resources. 

This evening should be spent designing and beginning to code out your project.
