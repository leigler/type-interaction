### Assignment 2: Active Reader

A reader is a curated collection of texts meant to explore or present a given topic. 

The Active Reader is a collaboratively built website that displays the readings, experiments, research and references we have collected and examined over the past week.

Your assignment is to design and build a part of our class’ web-reader. Your assignment consists of the development of a type system that can be applied to:
- A web-based table of contents (i.e. a menu section of your webpage)
- A selected reading typeset for the web in responsive html + CSS  (Your typeset reading should include: Title, Author, original publishing source and date, full text, links to any inspirational sources and directly related texts (either found in your own research or from the class list))
- A separately designed printable pdf of each reading (8.5x11”)

Each student’s reader contribution will be built into a resource hosted at [typeinteraction.teachinginter.net/reader](http://typeinteraction.teachinginter.net/reader) and is meant to act as a base resource for the rest of the semester.

Spend today researching and compiling visual and written resources, along with beginning your Sketch designs. 

This evening should be spent beginning to code out your site.
