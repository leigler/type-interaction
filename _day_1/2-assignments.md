### Exercise 2: Variable Formats

Prepare and package your Sketch file, and exchange it with a fellow student. Explain your document to your new friend. 
Using your new symbols, create the “same” composition at the following custom Sketch artboard dimensions:

- 375 x 667 (iPhone 6)
- 562.5 x 1,218 (iPhone X)
- 768 x 1024 (Tablet)
- 1440 x 900 (Desktop)

You will be expected to explain how your composition has reacted to the different dimensions.
