### Exercise 2: Variable Formats

Prepare and package your Sketch file (be sure to include the font files you used), and exchange it with a fellow student. Open a new Sketch document and import your received file as a Library.
Using your new symbols and text styles, create the “same” composition at the following custom Sketch artboard dimensions (i.e. create a simple page that acts responsively to different sizes):

- 375 x 667 (iPhone 6)
- 562.5 x 1,218 (iPhone X)
- 768 x 1024 (Tablet)
- 1440 x 900 (Desktop)

You will be expected to explain how your composition has reacted to the different dimensions.

Please upload your completed sketch documents and assets to the [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZQ0fJ3U7UB_Pc33-t2hlZx7exY2pGSSh?usp=sharing) under 'Exercise 2'

Create a folder with your name and inside place the document and any necessary assets. Please name your files as 'firstname_lastname_2'
