### Exercise 1: Compositions

Two main challenges introduced when designing for screen based media have come from the variation in screen sizes and introduction of movement based interactions. 

This exercise will explore the former. How do type hierarchies have to respond to variations in proportion and scale? Find a print piece or website w/ a wide range of typographic styles and content types.

Translate the various of levels of hierarchies into a set of 'type marks' that you can use in your composition. e.g. display type, header, sub-header, body text (Large body copy can be replaced with lorem ipsum for the time being.) You should have at least 4 levels of hierarchy defined.

We will do this by creating a single Sketch file w/ multiple symbols which will then be arranged to produce the final composition.

For these compositions please use a minimum of two typefaces and be ready to articulate thoughts as to how they relate to the content you have selected. Don't worry about legibility if it becomes an impediment.

Create 10 compositions at 375 x 667 (iPhone 6 dimensions).
