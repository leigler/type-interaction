### Exercise 1: Compositions

Two main challenges introduced when designing for screen based media have come from the variation in screen sizes and introduction of movement based interactions. 

This exercise will explore the former. How do type hierarchies have to respond to variations in proportion and scale? Find a print piece or website w/ a wide range of typographic styles and content types, e.g. New York Times, Political Posters, etc.

Translate the various of levels of hierarchies into a set of 'type marks' that you can use in your composition. e.g. display type, header, sub-header, body text (Large body copy can be replaced with lorem ipsum for the time being.) You should have at least 4 levels of hierarchy defined.

We will do this by creating a single Sketch file w/ multiple artboards that contain the various 'type marks' (symbols). Use these symbols to create your composition.

For these compositions please use a minimum of two typefaces and be ready to articulate preliminary thoughts as to how they relate to the content you have selected. A final consideration, given that these are simply introductory exercises, don't worry about legibility if it becomes an impediment.

using the 'type marks' generated, create 10 compositions at the following dimensions: 5.5" x 8.5" portrait.

### Exercise 2: Variable Formats

Prepare and package your Sketch file, and exchange it with a fellow student. Explain your document to your new friend. 
Using your new 'type marks', create the “same” composition at the following dimensions:

- 11" x 17" Portrait
- 8.5" x 11" landscape
- 4.25" x 11" landscape
- 4.25" x 7.5" portrait

You will be expected to explain how your composition has reacted to the different dimensions.
